## What I found interesting 

This article really clicked with me because it challenges a supper common instinct in software engineering; designing syatems to be endelessly extensible from the start.The author argues that a lot of future proofing can actually make code harder to work with as it adds abstractions and complexity before you truly know what the future needs are. Instead the article suggests optimizing for deletion writing code in a way that makes it easy to remove , replace or rewrite when requirements change(which they almost always do).

## Takeaway

If I had to summarize the lesson: **simplicity + low coupling beats speculative abstraction**. Codebases stay healthier when they’re built to evolve through real feedback rather than predicted futures.

## Outside Reflection (From Fork)
I found the article that you chose as very interesting. Not many of us think about the future of our code and are very captivated with the present - we just want to get it working. However, becoming advanced enough in our thinking and skills can make it so that we develop our code in a manner in which our future can become easier by being more intentional with our code and its place in the future.
